## List of Extra Requirements
This file contains requirements that are not explicitly stated in the list of requirements provided by the customer. These requirements are mostly implementation-based.

	* There will be 3 overloaded compareJobs methods: one to compare all jobs, another to compare current job with another job, and the last to compare 2 selected jobs.
	* Users will NOT be allowed to modify the job ranking algorithm.
	* Users will be allowed to change the weighting of each job field depending on what aspects they value the most, i.e. commute time, salary, bonus, retirement, etc.
	* Users must be given the option to edit specific fields of a job. For example, if they had a salary raise at their current job, they don't need to edit all the fields of their current job. They will just need to change their current salary. 
	* The data for each job will be stored in a SQLite Database.
	* The minimum SDK required to run the app is Android API 28: Android 9.0 (Pie).
