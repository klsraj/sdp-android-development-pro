# Test Plan

**Author**: Shu Liu (Team 120)

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

Unit Tests  
There will be a unit test for each class individually. The unit test will be performed by one group member, which is the main tester in our group.
After each module is built, it will be passed to the main tester to test with a few input to check the functionality. These tests should not be so complicated,
as more complex testing will be implemented in the integration part. And the unit test should ensure that each class work as expected so we can continuelly bulid the module.

Integration Tests  
Most of the integration tests will be performed mainly by the main tester, and some of the test will be performed by the developers. In the UML diagram, we have
five class for our job offer app. The integration test will focus on test the interaction among different modules. For example, it should test out the relation between job and joblist class,
also the interaction between weights and ranking list. These tests should be more complex than unit test, but make sure that the number of class involved in each integration test is not over three.

System Tests  
System test should be performed by main tester, and should test the complete system with its different functions. For example, system test should focus on how to edit the job, creat the joblist and compare different job together
for the system to work well with students. Some of the test cases might need the whole team to write together.

Regression Tests  
Regression tests should be performed by the main tester. After fixing the bugs or error from the integration and system test, 
old inputs should be run again to see if the expected results are achieved or not. For the reason that the unit test focus on every function generated by the class, 
it's important that those functions are not affected by fixing other bugs.


### 1.2 Test Selection
All the unit tests will be using white-box testing because we only focus on test the basic functionality of each individual class. For the integration tests, we will also use the white-box test to test the method and 
relation between several classes. For the system tests, we are going to use both white-box and black-box techniques to test the whole functionality.


### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
The test case will be evaluated on how well they fulfill the requirements of the app. Test should be consist with the UML design.  
Also the test case should statisfty the extrarequirement in the user documents.


### 1.4 Bug Tracking
Bugs will be reported in the github webpage so that the group member can discuss and come up with a solution according to each problems. 
Request enhancement can be done in the same way. We will take a look at the app after initial design and put all the suggetions together for the further refinement.


### 1.5 Technology
The majority of the test cases will be writen using Junit.Some IDE like Intellij will also be used to help the testing process.
